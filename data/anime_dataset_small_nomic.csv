"Bastard!! Ankoku no Hakaishin","Bastard!!","BASTARD!! 暗黒の破壊神","The characters in BASTARD!! have forsaken technology and have traded it in for magic and the occult arts. The story revolves around a group of five magicians who set out to rebuild their world after a rampaging God destroys it and tips it into chaos. Driven by their leader Dark Schneider, Gara, Arshes Nei, Abigail and Kall Su set out to conquer kingdoms in the hope of rebuilding them into utopias, with each of the magicians having their own personal agenda in doing so. However, Dark Schneiders often reckless manner and short temper leads him to wreak havoc where ever he goes. He is trapped by a group of clerics in a baby boy, leaving the four without a leader. Fifteen years later, the four still continue their quest but their motives have changed to despotic world domination, and it is up to Dark Schneider to show them the error of their ways, when he is freed by the clerics who once imprisoned him, so that he may defend them against his former comrades. It has now become Dark Schneiders responsibility to track down each one of his companions and set them on the right path again, but what seems to be the once reckless and amoral Dark Schneider has changed over his fifteen year imprisonment within the boy, Lucien Renlen.","AIC",\N,"Akiyama Katsuhito",\N,"Hagiwara Kazushi","Sumisawa Katsuyuki",\N,\N,"Tanaka Kouhei","Kitazume Hiroyuki","AIC","[""25.08.1992"", ""25.10.1992"", ""10.12.1992"", ""25.02.1993"", ""25.04.1993"", ""25.06.1993"", """", """"]","{""Yao Kazuki"": ""Dark Schneider"", ""Koyama Yuka"": ""Tia Nouto Youko"", ""Sakuma Rei"": ""Arshes Nei"", ""Tanaka Nobuo"": ""Jio Nouto Souto"", ""Kikuchi Masami"": ""Lars"", ""Genda Tesshou"": ""Ninja Master Gara"", ""Yoshida Konami"": ""Sheila Tuel Meta-llicana""}","OVA, 6 episodes","Summer 1992","25.08.1992 until 25.06.1993","nudity | violence | cast | antihero | nearly almighty protagonist | stereotypes | action | calling your attacks | martial arts | ninja | swordplay | comedy | ecchi | pantsu | speculative fiction | fantasy | dark fantasy | elf | dark elf | magic | spellcasting | undead | vampire | horror | super power | tragedy | tropes | call my name | trapped in the body of a child | visible aura | dark-skinned girl | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | creepy laugh | manly | Japanese production | manga | place | fictional location | time | past | alternative past | shounen | body and host | body takeover | damsel in distress | disaster | war | friendship | revenge | world domination","abilities | agile(3) | barrier creation(1) | dark magic(1) | disguising(1) | extreme durability(2) | fire magic(2) | fixed-form shapeshifting(1) | flying(2) | ice magic(1) | leadership(3) | levitation(1) | lightning magic(2) | magic(6) | ninjutsu(1) | petrifaction(1) | shapeshifting -- TO BE SPLIT AND DELETED(1) | stealth(2) | summoning(3) | accessories | armour(5) | belt bag(1) | bikini armour(1) | dagger(1) | flaming sword(2) | greave(1) | nodachi(1) | shoulder guards(2) | sword(3) | clothing | babydoll(1) | backless outfit(1) | bodysuit(1) | boots(3) | cape(5) | crop top(2) | dress(1) | half boots(1) | jacket(1) | knee boots(1) | leotard(1) | loose sleeves(2) | pencil skirt(1) | robe(1) | shorts(1) | single hosiery piece(1) | tank top(1) | thighhighs(1) | turtleneck(1) | entity | dark elf(1) | demon(1) | dragon(1) | vampire(1) | fashion accessories | belt(1) | choker(1) | elbow gloves(1) | gloves(1) | wrist cuffs(2) | fetish appeals | absolute cleavage(4) | bishoujo(1) | cleavage(3) | large breasts(4) | medium breasts(1) | reverse trap(1) | looks | animal claws(1) | black eyes(1) | black hair(5) | blue eyes(1) | blue hair(1) | braids(1) | brown eyes(2) | brown hair(2) | cuteness fang(1) | dark skin(1) | exposed midriff(3) | facial markings(1) | fangs(2) | goatee(1) | long hair(2) | moustache(1) | multicoloured hair(1) | muscular(2) | pale(1) | pointy ears(1) | purple eyes(2) | real horns(2) | red eyes(1) | red hair(1) | red skin(1) | short hair(2) | shoulder-length hair(2) | very long hair(2) | white hair(2) | wings(2) | yellow eyes(1) | yellow hair(1) | maintenance tags | PIC NEEDS IMPROVEMENT(1) | role | count(1) | ninja(1) | priest(1) | princess(1) | swordsman(3) | traits | adolescent(3) | alluring(1) | ambitious(1) | arrogant(2) | charismatic(1) | child(1) | compassionate(2) | confident(1) | evil laugh(1) | immortality(1) | insane smile(1) | loyal(2) | manly(1) | megalomaniac(2) | narcissistic(1) | overconfident(1) | physically strong(2) | scantily clad(4) | serious(1) | short-tempered(1) | tomboy(1) | young adult(3)",6.81,1239,"OVA",1992,"{""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard‼"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASTARD!!_暗黒の破壊神"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/88446"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/1979.html"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=519"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103775"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/404""}","9_a3514a8ffaa23ce4e6abe37962a29a7d6cfbb50115bbe403fcda0cefa7d8ce75.png",\N,"4_9e5f8bc47fdd9ce9a035a5a21f2d57e037a9817c8d06014cbc57835ffbe11478.png","4_9b8308515a7304ba903704aca7c847140f0f547ed463d731b7a74b35b6db5fa5"

"Chobits","Chobits","ちょびっツ","In the near future, personal computers take the form of attractive female androids, called Persocons. Motosuwa Hideki is a poor student who failed his entrance exams to get into college. So, Hideki is forced to move to the city, get a job, and attend cram school in hopes of passing the next college entrance exam. He would of course also like to own a Persocon, but is way too poor to afford one. One day, while returning home, he finds a Persocon in a trash heap.

"Shinseiki Evangelion","Neon Genesis Evangelion","新世紀エヴァンゲリオン","In the year 2015, the Angels, huge, tremendously powerful, alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time. The only hope for mankinds survival lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting machine developed by NERV, a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelions one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with an Evangelion. One such teenager is Ikari Shinji, whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelions. Thrust into a maelstrom of battles and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.","Gainax Tatsunoko Production",\N,"Anno Hideaki",\N,"Gainax",\N,\N,\N,"Sagisu Shirou","Sadamoto Yoshiyuki",\N,"[""04.10.1995"", ""11.10.1995"", ""18.10.1995"", ""25.10.1995"", ""01.11.1995"", ""08.11.1995"", ""15.11.1995"", ""22.11.1995"", ""29.11.1995"", ""06.12.1995"", ""13.12.1995"", ""20.12.1995"", ""27.12.1995"", ""03.01.1996"", ""10.01.1996"", ""17.01.1996"", ""24.01.1996"", ""31.01.1996"", ""07.02.1996"", ""14.02.1996"", ""21.02.1996"", ""28.02.1996"", ""06.03.1996"", ""13.03.1996"", ""20.03.1996"", ""27.03.1996"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", ""22.01.2021"", ""25.02.2000"", """"]","{""Hayashibara Megumi"": ""Ayanami Rei"", ""Ogata Megumi"": ""Ikari Shinji"", ""Mitsuishi Kotono"": ""Katsuragi Misato"", ""Miyamura Yuuko"": ""Souryuu Asuka Langley"", ""Iwanaga Tetsuya"": ""Aida Kensuke"", ""Yamaguchi Yuriko"": ""Akagi Ritsuko"", ""Kiyokawa Motomu"": ""Fuyutsuki Kouzou"", ""Nagasawa Miki"": ""Ibuki Maya"", ""Tachiki Fumihiko"": ""Ikari Gendou"", ""Yamadera Kouichi"": ""Kaji Ryouji""}","TV Series, 26 episodes","Autumn 1995","04.10.1995 until 27.03.1996","nudity | violence | gore | ending | open-ended | plot continuity | action | fighting | gunfights | angst | deconstruction | ecchi | breast fondling | pantsu | romance | social commentary | speculative fiction | daikaijuu | science fiction | alien | ancient aliens | human enhancement | genetic modification | mecha | organic mecha | robot | piloted robot | super robot | organism cloning | tropes | Tokyo is the centre of the universe | breasts | small breasts | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | Americas | United States | Asia | Japan | Europe | Germany | time | future | shounen | adapted into other media | adapted into manga | adapted into video game | experimental animation | multi-anime projects | Super Robot Wars | panels that require pausing | conspiracy | death | suicide | disaster | end of the world | post-apocalyptic | Tokyo destroyed | war | child soldier | existentialism | military | air force | navy | paradise lost | religion | Christianity | school life | middle school | sociocultural evolution | camping | changing room scene | cinema visit | eating ramen | first kiss | flashback | furo scene | grave visit | hot springs visit | late for school | omimai | parting | piggyback ride | pool episode | school excursion | shower scene | skipping school | stargazing | swimsuit shopping | transfer student | wedding","abilities | barrier creation(1) | clever(2) | cooking(1) | gardening(1) | leadership(1) | lethal chef(1) | levitation(5) | multilingual(2) | playing cello(1) | playing guitar(1) | regeneration(2) | time manipulation(1) | accessories | assault rifle(2) | box cutter(1) | eye visor(1) | glasses(3) | knife(3) | pistol(1) | rifle(3) | rocket launcher(1) | sniper rifle(1) | spear(1) | sunglasses(1) | video camera(1) | clothing | bodysuit(3) | high heels(1) | lab coat(2) | military uniform(2) | school uniform(3) | entity | alien(17) | angel -

"Cowboy Bebop","Cowboy Bebop","カウボーイビバップ","The year is 2071 AD. With the systematic collapse of the old nationstates, a mixed jumble of races and peoples were driven out of their terrestrial Eden and spread to the stars, taking with them the now confused concepts of justice, freedom, violence, and love. New rules were established, and a new generation of bounty hunters came into being. People referred to these bounty hunters as cowboys. Meet Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, a drifter and a retired cyborg cop who have started a bounty hunting partnership. In the converted ship The Bebop, Spike and Jet search the galaxy for criminals with bounties on their heads. They meet a lot of interesting characters, including the unusually intelligent dog Ein, the bizarre hacker child prodigy Ed, and the voluptuous and vexing femme fatale, Faye

In 2007, after extensive rescinding of the network, an online network game MMORPG called The World is created and released. Tsukasa suddenly awakens to find himself in The World, being able to feel, smell, touch, see and hear everything as if he was really there. He attempts to log out but fails to do so. Being unable to remember what has happened before he awoke, he wanders around aimlessly to find answers. While doing so, system moderators, the Scarlet Knights, suspect that he has been working with hackers, because of a tweaked catfaced character he had been seen with.

To Tsukasas dismay it turns out that this guardian can not only easily defeat player characters in the game, but actually badly hurt players in the real world. On his search for truth, Tsukasa encounters the friendly and supportive Mimiru, the wise, fatherly Bear, the manipulative BT, the unscrupulous Sora, the funloving Crim, and the mysterious Subaru, leader of the Scarlet Knights. When a mythical item called the Key of the Twilight turns out to be less of a myth, Tsukasa, questions whom he can really trust, and what the power to overcome The Worlds system limitations actually entails...","Bee Train",\N,"Mashimo Kouichi",\N,"Project .hack","Itou Kazunori",\N,\N,"Kajiura Yuki","Ban Yukiko Iwaoka Yuuko Oosawa Satoshi Shiba Minako","Bee Train","[""04.04.2002"", ""11.04.2002"", ""18.04.2002"", ""25.04.2002"", ""02.05.2002"", ""09.05.2002"", ""16.05.2002"", ""23.05.2002"", ""30.05.2002"", ""06.06.2002"", ""13.06.2002"", ""20.06.2002"", ""27.06.2002"", ""04.07.2002"", ""11.07.2002"", ""18.07.2002"", ""25.07.2002"", ""01.08.2002"", ""08.08.2002"", ""15.08.2002"", ""22.08.2002"", ""29.08.2002"", ""05.09.2002"", ""12.09.2002"", ""19.09.2002"", ""26.09.2002"", ""28.03.2003"", ""24.10.2003"", """", """"]","{""Saiga Mitsuki"": ""Tsukasa"", ""Hiramatsu Akiko"": ""BT"", ""Nakata Kazuhiro"": ""Bear"", ""Miki Shin`ichirou"": ""Crim"", ""Chiba Isshin"": ""Ginkan"", ""Toyoguchi Megumi"": ""Mimiru"", ""Yanaka Hiroshi"": ""Sora"", ""Nazuka Kaori"": ""Subaru""}","TV Series, 26 episodes","Spring 2002","04.04.2002 until 26.09.2002","nudity | violence | cast | ensemble cast | ending | open-ended | plot continuity | slow-paced | storytelling | dialogue driven | time skip | action | swordplay | adventure | angst | comedy | parody | manipulated memories | mystery | romance | love polygon | shoujo ai | unrequited love | social commentary | speculative fiction | fantasy | magic | magic circles | spellcasting | super power | tropes | heroic sacrifice | cross-dressing | reverse trap | dark-skinned girl | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | immature | tsundere | Japanese production | new | place | desert | Earth | Asia | Japan | fictional location | virtual world | time | present | alternative present | seinen | detailed landscapes | amnesia | child abuse | existentialism | family life | dysfunctional family | friendship | isekai | jealousy | law and order | teamwork | flashback | preview before ed","abilities | agile(1) | hacking(1) | regeneration(1) | teleportation(1) | accessories | bikini armour(1) | buster sword(2) | glasses(1) | shoulder guards(1) | skimpy armour(4) | sword(2) | wheelchair(1) | clothing | boots(1) | entity | artificial intelligence(2) | avatar(31) | human(5) | fashion accessories | choker(3) | earring(1) | evening gloves(1) | gloves(1) | hat(1) | sweatband(1) | fetish appeals | reverse trap(1) | small breasts(1) | looks | blue eyes(1) | blue hair(3) | brown hair(4) | cyan hair(1) | dark skin(2) | exposed midriff(5) | green eyes(2) | green hair(1) | grey hair(1) | long hair(3) | moustache(1) | orange hair(1) | ponytail(1) | purple eyes(3) | purple hair(1) | red eyes(2) | short hair(3) | shoulder-length hair(1) | tareme(2) | twintails(1) | very long hair(1) | white hair(2) | yellow eyes(1) | yellow hair(3) | maintenance tags | PIC NEEDS IMPROVEMENT(5) | nationality | Japanese(2) | role | swordsman(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | albino(1) | ambitious(1) | child(1) | clumsy(1) | cynical(1) | paraplegic(1) | scantily clad(1)",7.94,1413,"TV Series",2002,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.beetrain.co.jp/contents/works/sign/"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//Sign"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack//SIGN"", ""Crunchyroll"": ""https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GY19710QR/"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/237599"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/5287.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/466/time"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1487"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361140"", ""TMDB"": ""https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/8864""}","23_380208d69d7473b17207460bbf0af55d012dd9f3b31963bcdb565f8b7ddb4758.png",\N,"23_380208d69d7473b17207460bbf0af55d012dd9f3b31963bcdb565f8b7ddb4758.png",\N

"Bubblegum Crisis","Bubblegum Crisis","バブルガムクライシス","The year is 2033, and MegaTokyo is just beginning to recover from a devastating earthquake that completely rearranged the face of Tokyo. Part of the recovery is due to the recent advancement in Boomer technology. Boomers are androids that look, think, and act almost like human beings. They can be put to work, perform as soldiers in the military, or mysteriously go berserk and terrorise the population. The corporation responsible for all the major Boomer advancements is a monolithic company called GENOM. But GENOM has a rather underhanded secret agenda to take over the world. With the world dependent on Boomer technology, there does not seem to be much that can stand in GENOMs way. Only a mercenary team of four young women, the Knight Sabers, equipped with hardsuits, have the courage and the firepower to stand up to rampaging Boomers and the company behind them.","AIC","Urushihara Satoshi","Akiyama Katsuhito Gouda Hiroaki Hayashi Hiroki Oobari Masami Takayama Fumihiko",\N,"Suzuki Toshimitsu",\N,\N,"Suzuki Toshimitsu","Makaino Kouji","Sonoda Ken`ichi","AIC Artmic","[""25.02.1987"", ""05.09.1987"", ""05.12.1987"", ""24.07.1988"", ""25.12.1988"", ""30.08.1989"", ""14.03.1990"", ""30.01.1991"", ""24.04.1988"", ""27.06.1990"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", ""27.06.1990"", ""27.06.1990"", ""24.04.1988"", ""27.06.1990"", ""27.06.1990"", ""24.04.1988"", ""24.04.1988"", ""24.04.1988"", ""24.04.1988"", ""27.06.1990"", """", ""27.06.1990"", """"]","{""Tomizawa Michie"": ""Linna Yamazaki"", ""Hiramatsu Akiko"": ""Nene Romanova"", ""Oomori Kinuko"": ""Priscilla S.

Three goddesses from heaven appeared at the door of a likable young college student. The goddesses used their many powers to help people find happiness. And sometimes for a lark they would make themselves small. from intro Spring, love is in the air and Gan the rat gets a lot more than he bargains for with the help of Urds fortune telling. Urd, Skuld and Gan are sunbathing when another rat falls through the ceiling mumbling about arms and arms of gold somewhere in the attic. Skuld assembles three treasurehunting thingamajiggies and the adventure is on. Gan, sitting on the temple roof enjoying the sun, wishes he could fly like a bird... Urd is only too happy to grant that wish, or something along those lines. When Skuld offers her assistance via another set of her gadgets only deep space seems to be the limit. Having gained too much weight, Urd and Skuld are only too happy to help Gan slim down to normal using Skulds brand new gadgets and Urds latest concoction. Eating a not so fresh piece of cake, Gan ends up with a stomach ache. The cures that Urd and Skuld think up are worse than the ailment though, turning the poor Gan into Gabira, the Giant Monster. Thankfully, Belldandy usually stays out of helping even more... written by foo2","OLM","Oohashi Sachiko","Matsumura Yasuhiro",\N,"Fujishima Kousuke","Houjou Chinatsu Yoshimura Genki",\N,\N,"Murayama Tatsuya","Kazui Hiroko","Bee Train","[""06.04.1998"", ""13.04.1998"", ""20.04.1998"", ""27.04.1998"", ""11.05.1998"", ""18.05.1998"", ""25.05.1998"", ""01.06.1998"", ""08.06.1998"", ""15.06.1998"", ""22.06.1998"", ""29.06.1998"", ""06.07.1998"", ""13.07.1998"", ""20.07.1998"", ""27.07.1998"", ""03.08.1998"", ""10.08.1998"", ""24.08.1998"", ""31.08.1998"", ""07.09.1998"", ""14.09.1998"", ""21.09.1998"", ""28.09.1998"", ""05.10.1998"", ""12.10.1998"", ""19.10.1998"", ""26.10.1998"", ""02.11.1998"", ""09.11.1998"", ""16.11.1998"", ""30.11.1998"", ""07.12.1998"", ""14.12.1998"", ""21.12.1998"", ""04.01.1999"", ""11.01.1999"", ""18.01.1999"", ""25.01.1999"", ""01.02.1999"", ""08.02.1999"", ""15.02.1999"", ""22.02.1999"", ""01.03.1999"", ""08.03.1999"", ""15.03.1999"", ""22.03.1999"", ""29.03.1999"", """", """", """", """"]","{""Inoue Kikuko"": ""Belldandy"", ""Okamura Akemi"": ""Belldandy"", ""Iwata Mitsuo"": ""Gan"", ""Hisakawa Aya"": ""Skuld"", ""Touma Yumi"": ""Urd"", ""Takano Urara"": ""Marller""}","TV Series, 48 episodes","Spring 1998","06.04.1998 until 29.03.1999","nudity | violence | cast | stereotypes | plot continuity | action | gunfights | martial arts | ninja | adventure | anthropomorphism | comedy | medium awareness | parody | satire | slapstick | catastrophic gadgets | super deformed | ecchi | skimpy clothing | educational | romance | love polygon | unrequited love | speculative fiction | daikaijuu | fantasy | contemporary fantasy | deity | demon | magic | science fiction | alien | mecha | robot | piloted robot | robot helper | the lives of mini-people | tropes | sibling yin yang | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | clone | evil laugh | flying | Japanese production | manga | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | space | shipboard | time | present | season | spring | summer | winter | product placement | short episodes | short story collection | watercolour style | be careful what you wish for | cooking | crime | curse | daily life | mythology | Norse mythology | politics | propaganda | rivalry | sibling rivalry | sports | baseball | the arts | music | idol | musical band | babysitting | birthday | confession | date | eating Pocky | first kiss | furo scene | hanami | journey to the center of the mind | making nabe | omiai | rock-paper-scissors","abilities | barrier creation(1) | clever(1) | flying(1) | genius(1) | healing(1) | inter-dimensional travel(1) | levitation(1) | magic(1) | talks to animals(1) | accessories | goggles(1) | mobile phone(1) | war hammer(1) | clothing | dress(1) | harem pants(1) | jacket(1) | swimsuit(1) | thighhighs(1) | entity | deity(4) | demon(2) | domestic cat(1) | human(1) | rat(13) | talking animal(2) | fashion accessories | bracelet(1) | choker(1) | earring(2) | elbow gloves(1) | evening gloves(1) | gloves(2) | ring(1) | fetish appeals | absolute cleavage(1) | cleavage(1) | medium breasts(2) | yamato nadeshiko(1) | looks | ahoge(1) | bat wings(1) | black fur(1) | black hair(1) | blue eyes(1) | brown eyes(2) | brown hair(2) | cuteness fang(1) | dark skin(1) | exposed midriff(1) | facial markings(3) | fangs(1) | feathered wings(3) | hair antennae(1) | hosome(1) | long hair(4) | permanently closed eyes(1) | ponytail(1) | purple eyes(1) | red eyes(1) | short hair(1) | sidelocks(1) | tsurime(1) | white hair(1) | wings(1) | yellow hair(1) | nationality | Japanese(1) | role | butt monkey(1) | inventor(1) | mechanic(1) | motorcyclist(1) | ninja(3) | politician(1) | salaryman(1) | school club member(1) | student(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | alluring(1) | altruistic(2) | brave(1) | carbonate drunken(1) | charismatic(1) | competitive(1) | energetic(2) | idealist(1) | impulsive(1) | kind(3) | manipulative(1) | naive(1) | optimistic(1) | polite(1) | selfish(1) | short-tempered(1) | young adult(3) | type | robot helper(3)",6.73,1276,"TV Series",1998,"{""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_My_Goddess!#The_Adventures_of_Mini-Goddess"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ああっ女神さまっ#.E3.81.82.E3.81.82.E3.81.A3.E5.A5.B3.E7.A5.9E.E3.81.95.E3.81.BE.E3.81.A3_.E5.B0.8F.E3.81.A3.E3.81.A1.E3.82.83.E3.81.84.E3.81.A3.E3.81.A6.E4.BA.8B.E3.81.AF.E4.BE.BF.E5.88.A9.E3.81.A0.E3.81.AD.E3.81.A3"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/125545"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/1643.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/1301/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=266"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/303""}","173_c4e1d429b18b9413a83784b6d89d99d741a62a64dc726bf8e458ec2e01b32a58.png",\N,"117_2a513b4a05b3dffdecf28a58da5639265e27dd1dea1c96fae3105da93ab56921.png","117_e424299ae9b9210d1023a96d076a4bd87a0960469357bb0ccab0fa088e3ef408"

No one would buy burnt bread or be nice to him, so Kogepan became an outcast with no emotion for others. He ran away from home, gets drunk off milk, smokes, and always says negative things about himself. To pass the time, Kogepan reads books on how to become better bread and teaches the pretty bread what he knows of life. He dreams that someday if he works hard enough, he can be worth something too.","Studio Deen",\N,"Ohara Hidekazu",\N,"Takahashi Miki","Sogo Masashi",\N,\N,"Nakamura Yuriko","Kobayashi Takashi","Four Some","["""", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"]","{""Ishida Akira"": ""Cream Pan"", ""Mizuhara Rin"": ""Kogepan""}","TV Series, 10 episodes","Autumn 2001","05.11.2001 until 16.11.2001","angst | comedy | tragedy | Japanese production | short episodes | cooking","entity | bread(10)",6.35,592,"TV Series",2001,"{""Official website"": ""http://pierrot.jp/archives/tv_list_2000/tv_056.html"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogepan"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/こげぱん"", "".lain"": ""http://lain.gr.jp/mediadb/media/685"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/236707"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/5021.html"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1653"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/580""}","188_38f8afc509854bdf68c0ec5a7333b91839f1a76a9465941e691ab9103fb771a8.png","125_011e0c183cc127e63aed7ce0ba9810e5360e1445cbdfbc38148da08b3ff52a3e.png","125_eea080e90b138f1b6e777b8e2709776cc88d02b86c38f80bdbaa5e11f7de8383.png","125_23f2eb18acc01bb50be95cf88f9b1f9a674b8523161522ba9f3fed66837f53a8"

"Neoranga","Neo Ranga","南海奇皇[ネオランガ]","The three beautiful Shimabara sisters, Minami, Ushio and Yuuhi, by some strange twist of fate, are inadvertently linked to a gigantic monstergod who hails from a tiny island kingdom in the South Pacific called Barou. After being invited to the island of Barou, the three girls learn of their missing older brothers fate, as well as the fact that they are to inherit this island kingdom in the absence of a suitable male heir. Upon visiting the idol of Ranga deep within the jungle, the irritated trio actually manages to awaken the sleeping giant from its dormancy. With this event in mind, it comes as no surprise to them when the lumbering behemoth Neo Ranga arrives in Tokyo months later to seek out its three lovely masters. Instead of rolling out the red carpet for their gigantic friend, the Japanese SelfDefense Forces roll out the tanks and artillery to halt the behemoths advance through downtown Tokyo. The arrival of Neo Ranga in Tokyo is but the first of many in a long series of chaotic events that are thrust upon the Shimabara sisters and their colossal companion in this zany romp through the lives of three beautiful sisters, their nephew Joel and the gigantic monster they love.","Studio Pierrot","Hirai Hisashi","Kamiya Jun","Tsuru Toshiyuki","Aikawa Shou Pony Canyon Studio Pierrot","Aikawa Shou",\N,"Yatate Hajime","Haishima Kuniaki","Tanaka Hiroto","Hal Film Maker","[""06.04.1998"", ""13.04.1998"", ""20.04.1998"", ""27.04.1998"", ""11.05.1998"", ""18.05.1998"", ""25.05.1998"", ""01.06.1998"", ""08.06.1998"", ""15.06.1998"", ""22.06.1998"", ""29.06.1998"", ""06.07.1998"", ""13.07.1998"", ""20.07.1998"", ""27.07.1998"", ""03.08.1998"", ""10.08.1998"", ""24.08.1998"", ""31.08.1998"", ""07.09.1998"", ""14.09.1998"", ""21.09.1998"", ""28.09.1998"", ""06.04.1999"", ""13.04.1999"", ""20.04.1999"", ""27.04.1999"", ""04.05.1999"", ""11.05.1999"", ""18.05.1999"", ""25.05.1999"", ""01.06.1999"", ""08.06.1999"", ""15.06.1999"", ""22.06.1999"", ""29.06.1999"", ""06.07.1999"", ""13.07.1999"", ""27.07.1999"", ""03.08.1999"", ""17.08.1999"", ""24.08.1999"", ""31.08.1999"", ""07.09.1999"", ""14.09.1999"", ""21.09.1999"", ""28.09.1999"", """", """", """", """"]","{""Sumitomo Yuuko"": ""Shimabara Minami"", ""Miyamura Yuuko"": ""Shimabara Ushio"", ""Sendai Eri"": ""Shimabara Yuuhi""}","TV Series, 48 episodes","Spring 1998","06.04.1998 until 28.09.1999","nudity | violence | gore | cast | ensemble cast | multiple protagonists - TO BE MOVED TO PARENT OR DELETED | female protagonist | ending | open-ended | in medias res | plot continuity | storytelling | narration | tone changes | action | collateral damage | adventure | angst | comedy | absurdist humour | black humour | funny expressions | parody | satire | slapstick | horny nosebleed | violent retribution for accidental infringement | toilet humour | deconstruction | ecchi | Gainax bounce | lingerie | sudden naked girl appearance | wardrobe malfunction | incest | monster of the week | romance | shoujo ai | social commentary | speculative fiction | daikaijuu | fantasy | horror | human cannibalism | science fiction | ancient aliens | mecha | organic mecha | robot | piloted robot | real robot | super robot | tropes | adults are useless | military is useless | heroic sacrifice | lost technology | breasts | large breasts | small breasts | cross-dressing | trap | dark-skinned girl | loli | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | biting | corrupt | orphan | spy | TO BE MOVED TO EPISODE | skirt flipping | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | Tokyo | Oceania | island | time | present | alternative present | season | summer | seinen | CGI | half-length episodes | real-world location | alcohol | betrayal | child abuse | coming of age | coup d`etat | crime | hostage situation | mafia | daily life | working life | death | murder | massacre | suicide | disaster | war | asymmetric warfare | war-zone realities | family life | family values | parental abandonment | law and order | police | military | navy | money | poverty | politics | propaganda | psychoactive drugs | rotten world | school life | elementary school | middle school | secret organisation | beach visit | boobs in your face | Christmas | fireworks | flashback | furo scene | hot springs visit | nopan | pool episode","accessories | scythe(1) | shield(1) | sword(1) | clothing | sneakers(1) | entity | human(3) | looks | blue hair(1) | brown hair(1) | facial markings(3) | long hair(1) | purple eyes(1) | red eyes(1) | red hair(1) | skin markings(3) | yellow eyes(1) | role | student(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | aloof(1) | altruistic(1) | child(1) | high alcohol tolerance(1) | low alcohol tolerance(1) | popular(1) | protection complex(1) | reserved(1) | selfish(1) | shy(1) | tomboy(1) | young adult(1)",6.25,1196,"TV Series",1998,"{""Official website"": ""https://pierrot.jp/archive/1995/tv90_20.html"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Ranga"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/南海奇皇"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/90288"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/2055.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/1274/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1052"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1163""}","207_c6a71f99d485931b3a9f4294bef0423625715c6b01b8dbb2e14445f5411865cb.png","138_31ac86f491827d9dca5feab107e400eaf2d3532131fca22de848691202ebead0.png","138_b15076fc467aa45e8ab54c84df25bedfc85a738bcfddc4fd54ff967eb6805af5.png","138_f9bb0ebcc14e41d95073db18fc7e1d7bb3eda5cb922021a956d5ad0a23a38d0c"

"Dragon Ball","Dragon Ball","DRAGON BALL","Bulma is a girl from the city with a wish. In order to fulfill her wish, she set out to collect seven mystical spheres known as the Dragon Balls. It is said that, when the seven Dragon Balls are brought together, one may invoke their lord, Shenron, an almighty dragon god who can and will grant any wish, but only one. In Bulmas search, she traveled far and wide, until one day she met a strange but very strong boy with a tail. The boy, Son Gokuu, lived by himself in a small place in the middle of the wilderness. It turns out that Gokuu has a Dragon Ball, but he will not let go of it, no matter what after all, that Dragon Ball is his only memento of his late grandfather, the man who raised him. Being unused to dealing with other people and never having seen a female his whole life, Gokuu is highly tactless. However, Bulma sees the value of having his strength to protect her in her journey and realises that he wont let give away his Dragon Ball easily, so she convinces him to go with her. As she seeks the remaining Dragon Balls in order to make her wish come true, he embarks on a quest to see the world and become stronger thus begins their a journey together, a journey in which they will face many perils and meet many people, friends and foes alike. written by Hinoe","Toei Animation","Maeda Minoru","Nishio Daisuke Okazaki Minoru",\N,"Toriyama Akira","Koyama Takao","Hiramatsu

"Dragon Ball GT","Dragon Ball GT","DRAGON BALL GT","An anime that really has nothing to do with the original stories of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It was made because fans wanted more. After departing the World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku and Uub are nearly finished with their intense training session at the Lookout. In fact, Dende considers it a miracle that the Lookout is still in one piece! But all is not well. Emperor Pilaf has managed to summon Shenron! With the planets future hanging by a single wish from Pilafs mouth, Goku braces for the worst. What does Pilaf desire? And more importantly, what does he get?! See where the final chapter of Gokus incredible story begins! A note about the FUNimation release of the Dragon Ball GT series US market Episodes were renumbered compared to original release. Episode 1 is a summary of episodes 116 of the original Japanese version 64 episodes. This is why its only 49 episodes 64 minus 15. However, after FUNimation released the US version of GT 49 episodes, they decided it was a good idea to also release the 16 episodes they left out in their US version. Hence The Lost Episodes were born. These episodes are nothing more than the US version of the original first 16 episodes of the Japanese version of GT. Therefore, if you combine The Lost Episodes with the US version and discard the first episode of the US version, you will get the 64 episodes that the Japanese Version of GT consists of, and you will have a complete version of Dragon Ball GT in English. If this does not make sense to you, please contact FUNimation for more information. P A note about the German TV release of the Dragonball GT series the special is buyable only on DVD The channel RTL 2 did not air 13 episodes. The episodes which were not aired are 29, 38, 46, 47, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62 and 63.","Toei Animation","Miyahara Naoki","Kasai Osamu",\N,"Toriyama Akira","Matsui Aya",\N,\N,"Tokunaga Akihito","Nakatsuru Katsuyoshi",\N,"[""07.02.1996"", ""14.02.1996"", ""21.02.1996"", ""28.02.1996"", ""06.03.1996"", ""13.03.1996"", ""20.03.1996"", ""17.04.1996"", ""24.04.1996"", ""01.05.1996"", ""08.05.1996"", ""15.05.1996"", ""22.05.1996"", ""05.06.1996"", ""12.06.1996"", ""19.06.1996"", ""26.06.1996"", ""10.07.1996"", ""17.07.1996"", ""31.07.1996"", ""14.08.1996"", ""21.08.1996"", ""28.08.1996"", ""04.09.1996"", ""16.10.1996"", ""30.10.1996"", ""06.11.1996"", ""13.11.1996"", ""27.11.1996"", ""04.12.1996"", ""11.12.1996"", ""08.01.1997"", ""15.01.1997"", ""22.01.1997"", ""29.01.1997"", ""05.02.1997"", ""12.02.1997"", ""19.02.1997"", ""26.02.1997"", ""05.03.1997"", ""12.03.1997"", ""16.04.1997"", ""23.04.1997"", ""30.04.1997"", ""14.05.1997"", ""28.05.1997"", ""04.06.1997"", ""11.06.1997"", ""18.06.1997"", ""25.06.1997"", ""02.07.1997"", ""09.07.1997"", ""16.07.1997"", ""06.08.1997"", ""13.08.1997"", ""20.08.1997"", ""03.09.1997"", ""10.09.1997"", ""17.09.1997"", ""22.10.1997"", ""29.10.1997"", ""05.11.1997"", ""12.11.1997"", ""19.11.1997"", """", ""26.03.1997"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"]","{""Minaguchi Yuuko"": ""Pan"", ""Masuoka Hiroshi"": ""Kame Sennin"", ""Chiba Shigeru"": ""Pilaf"", ""Nozawa Masako"": ""Son Gokuu Son Gohan Son Goten"", ""Kusao Takeshi"": ""Trunks Trunks"", ""Kisaichi Atsushi"": ""Uub"", ""Horikawa Ryou"": ""Vegeta""}","TV Series, 64 episodes","Winter 1995/96","07.02.1996 until 19.11.1997","cast | nearly almighty protagonist | time skip | action | calling your attacks | collateral damage | fighting | martial arts | adventure | gotta catch them all | comedy | henshin | speculative fiction | fantasy | magic | science fiction | alien | space travel | super power | emotions awaken superpowers | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | ki manipulation | TO BE MOVED TO EPISODE | preview before ed | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | shounen | disaster | end of the world","abilities | aura sensing(1) | barrier creation(1) | extreme durability(2) | extreme speed(2) | flying(7) | ki blast(6) | ki manipulation(9) | levitation(1) | martial arts(7) | muscle enhancement(1) | teleportation(2) | accessories | armour(1) | glasses(1) | staff(1) | sunglasses(1) | sword(1) | weights(1) | clothing | bodysuit(1) | boots(1) | shorts(1) | vest(1) | entity | dragon(1) | half-breed(4) | human(3) | saiyajin(8) | fashion accessories | bandana(1) | cap(1) | earring(2) | gloves(1) | fetish appeals | loli(1) | small breasts(1) | looks | bald(2) | beard(1) | black eyes(2) | black hair(7) | blue eyes(1) | blue hair(2) | blue skin(1) | cyan eyes(1) | dark skin(1) | exposed midriff(1) | long hair(1) | mohawk(1) | muscular(3) | pointy ears(4) | purple skin(1) | red fur(1) | short(3) | shoulder-length hair(1) | spiked hair(3) | tail(3) | tareme(1) | tiny pupils(2) | very long hair(1) | white hair(1) | widow`s peak(1) | wings(3) | role | prince(2) | prodigy(1) | time traveller(1) | traits | Vegeta complex(1) | absent-minded(1) | adolescent(1) | age sensitive(1) | altruistic(1) | antisocial personality disorder(1) | arrogant(1) | brave(2) | bullying(1) | child(3) | confident(1) | cruel(1) | elderly(1) | emotionally stunted(1) | flirt(1) | greedy(1) | honourable(1) | immortality(1) | insane smile(1) | kind(1) | manipulative(1) | megalomaniac(1) | overeater(5) | pacifist(1) | perverted(1) | pettanko(1) | physically strong(2) | proud(1) | simple-minded(1) | underhanded(1) | xenophobia(1)",6.04,1793,"TV Series",1996,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/dragongt/"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/987"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ドラゴンボールGT"", ""Crunchyroll"": ""https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G4PH0WXXM/"", ""Funimation"": ""https://www.funimation.com/shows/dragon-ball-gt/"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/88946"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/964.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/2598/time""}","215_5cb2de25ab3beef845e997dfbb3699885b6fde343275326d5c5e9c4ae51794a9.png","145_d6eb4555e50e045388efb299779cecd6287bd31d4679bf27da0a47d3e566a787.png","145_3cc3363a3dcd434bfdb9925da80032c77ff68c90c0ac5704a2e16179371802c4.png","145_7dc0e64f2cd983cf33ee4f16c6bf703fd0868f6265b88896128e651368f8d99a"

"Armitage III: Poly Matrix","Armitage III: Poly Matrix","アミテージ・ザ・サード POLY-MATRIX","In 2179 Mars has been colonized by Earth, populated by humans and Second Types robots robots designed to perform the menial tasks humans will not do. Then there are the Third Types illegal androids designed by a nationalist force to look and behave exactly like humans living undetected among the Martian population as citizens, until one man, Rene dAnclaude, declares war on the Thirds, starting a massacre in a vow to destroy them all. Naomi Armitage is a cyberpunk Martian cop in hot pants, with an attitude as deadly as her gun. She is also a Third, and her fight against DAnclaude is a fight for her survival. Her partner, Ross Sylibus, lost his partner at the hands of a cybernetic killer and hates robots. Ross must face this prejudice when he is injured and received cybernetic limb replacements, bringing him closer to becoming one of the monsters he abhors. He begins to realize that being human is more then just flesh and blood and joins Armitage in her fight against DAnclaude and her quest to discover the mystery of why the Third Type was created. Armitage and Ross are brought together in a bond of love and hope as their journey uncovers a secret that could destroy two worlds!","Pioneer LDC","Kawashima Keiko Nakayama Yumi","Ochi Hiroyuki",\N,"Takahashi Miki","Amiya Masaharu",\N,\N,"Nanba Hiroyuki","Ochi Hiroyuki","J.C.Staff","[""20.04.1996"", ""20.04.1996"", ""20.04.1996"", ""20.04.1996"", ""20.04.1996"", ""20.04.1996"", """"]","{""Ishida Akira"": ""Cream Pan"", ""Mizuhara Rin"": ""Kogepan""}","Movie","Spring 1996","20.04.1996","violence | gore | cast | stereotypes | strong female lead | action | gunfights | martial arts | detective | social commentary | speculative fiction | science fiction | cyberpunk | Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? | mecha | power suit | robot | android | human-android love | space travel | thriller | tropes | ass-kicking girls | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | gun - TO BE SPLIT AND DELETED | violent | wings | Japanese production | place | space | other planet | Mars | time | future | amnesia | crime | terrorism | death | murder | massacre | law and order | police | sociocultural evolution","abilities | agile(1) | clever(1) | gun marksmanship(1) | martial arts(1) | accessories | cigarette(1) | handcuffs(1) | lighter(1) | pistol(2) | skimpy armour(1) | sunglasses(1) | clothing | boots(1) | brassiere(1) | coat(1) | corset(1) | short shorts(1) | stocking suspender belt(1) | thighhighs(1) | thong(1) | entity | android(3) | cyborg(1) | fashion accessories | choker(1) | earring(1) | gloves(2) | peaked cap(1) | fetish appeals | androgynous(1) | looks | black hair(1) | blue eyes(1) | brown hair(1) | dark skin(1) | exposed midriff(1) | grey hair(1) | short hair(4) | tanned(1) | yellow hair(1) | nationality | American(1) | role | police officer(2) | terrorist(1) | traits | adolescent(2) | brave(1) | energetic(1) | introvert(1) | level-headed(1) | middle aged(2) | passionate(1) | scantily clad(1) | smoker(1)",6.95,1194,"Movie",1996,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.anime-int.com/works/armitage/movie1/index.html"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armitage_III#Armitage_III_and_Poly-Matrix"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/アミテージ・ザ・サード"", ""Amazon"": ""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CBQ39DG"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/152845"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/3792.html"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=483"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109151"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/493"", ""TMDB"": ""https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/33322""}","218_f0255d6888320c733709bacab5d899c829cf1c5f79387362a8c47dbe1a006ad9.png",\N,"218_f0255d6888320c733709bacab5d899c829cf1c5f79387362a8c47dbe1a006ad9.png",\N

"Naruto","Naruto","NARUTO","Naruto closely follows the life of a boy who is feared and detested by the villagers of the hidden leaf village of Konoha. The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but its whats inside him that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi demon fox with great fury and power waged war taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss but with hard work, Naruto may achieve Hokage.","Studio Pierrot","Matsubara Hidenori","Date Hayato","Ishiguro Noboru","Kishimoto Masashi","Sumisawa

"Kiddy Grade","Kiddy Grade","機動戦士ガンダム 第08MS小隊","This is the first work by director Gotou Keiji, the character designer of Kidou Senkan Nadesico and Gate Keepers. In the distant future, humans have rapidly spread across the galaxy, creating thousands of independent planetary states. However, as humans begin to colonise more and more star systems, the scale of the skirmishes between planets escalates. The Intergalactic Planetary Federation IPF was established to maintain peace and stability, to promote economic prosperity, and to head off the threat of largescale war. An era of peace prevails, but as each star system begins to prosper, so do the economic markets, which become the new battlegrounds.

"Legend of Basara","Armitage III: Poly Matrix","LEGEND OF BASARA","Basara takes place in Japan, about 300 years from a large disaster that occurred around now the 1990s or soon after. After the disaster humanity and civilization crumbled, and Japan, as an island country, fell into isolation and disrepair. The climate changed, and some parts were turned into desert, while others were filled with all sorts of strange creatures. But at the start of the manga, we are not sure which parts of Japan have been changed, and how, except for where the main character, a girl named Sarasa, grew up. That part, Hyakko village, just north of Shikoku, had been turned to desert, and that is where the story begins. Sarasa is the twin sister of a boy named Tatara, who was prophesied to be the one to lead all out of submission. The submission written of is that of the cruel kings who war against each other for control of Japan each control a sector of it, but none have yet been able to reign supreme. One of them, The Red King, learns of this prophecy and sends an army to exterminate the village.

"Maison Ikkoku",\N,"めぞん一刻","Based on the manga written and illustrated by Takahashi Rumiko and serialised in the manga magazine Big Comic Spirits. The story takes place in Maison Ikkoku, a worn and aging boarding house where Godai Yuusaku, a 20 year old college applicant lives. Though honest and good natured, he is weak willed and often taken advantage of by the offbeat and mischievous tenants who live with him. As he is about to move out, he is stopped at the door by the young and beautiful Otonashi Kyouko, who announces she will be taking over as landlord. Godai immediately falls in love with her and decides to stay. Later, Godai and the other tenants find out that despite her young age, she is a widow, as she married her high school teacher, but he died shortly after their marriage. Godai empathizes with her and endeavors to free her from her sadness. He manages to work up enough courage to confess his love to her, and it begins to look like that a relationship between them might actually appear... until Kyouko meets the rich, handsome, and charming Mitaka Shun. Mitaka quickly declares his intention to court Kyouko and states that he is very patient, and can wait until her heart is ready.","Studio Deen",\N,"Kazuo Yamazaki","Annou Takashi Yamazaki Kazuo

With a pretty face, timid character and such dependency on his puppet friend Ukon, no one would expect that he is the one his policewoman aunt Kaoruko would turn to when she tries to solve seemingly perfect crimes. When controlling Ukon, Sakon instantly changes from a timid boy into a quiet, contemplative detective. Quite a contrast to Ukon, an exuberant chatterbox, who is much more into pop stars and talking to girls. This unlikely pair can untangle the criminals web of deception, and comprehend the victims way of thinking. As Sakons grandfather once said Controlling a puppet is like reading the heart.

"Tenshi no Tamago","Angel`s Egg","天使のたまご","The plot for Tenshi no Tamago is not something that can easily be related in words. The film is largely about the presentation more than action, and understatement instead of open revelation. Existentialism abounds, heightened by the moody artwork and the dialogue, which asks more questions than it answers. Bear in mind, however, that the conflict in the plotline primarily occurs in the audiences mind, not in any sequence of actions in the film, spurred by speculation arising from one jarring impression after another. There are only two primary characters in Tenshi no Tamago a young girl who bears an egg and a man who holds a strange cross. The audience is left to speculate as to the identities and true personalities of these two images which act in this disturbing world. Indeed, much of their dialogue involves the question dare ka who are you. For such an existential film, however, this is perfect, as any open declaration of their thoughts, instead of such questions and mysterious actions, would ruin the mystery of the film.","Studio DEEN",\N,"Oshii Mamoru",\N,\N,\N,\N,"Amano Yoshitaka Oshii Mamoru",\N,\N,"Studio Deen","[""15.12.1985"", """"]","{""Hyoudou Mako"": ""Shoujo"", ""Nezu Jinpachi"": ""Shounen""}","OVA","Autumn 1985","15.12.1985","ending | open-ended | slow-paced | speculative fiction | fantasy | dark fantasy | thriller | Japanese production | new | place | fictional location | seinen | experimental animation | remastered version available | short movie | stand-alone movie | disaster | flood | post-apocalyptic | religion | Christianity","accessories | bandage wrapping(1) | clothing | boilersuit(1) | boots(1) | cloak(1) | fashion accessories | hair clip(1) | ribbon -- TO BE SPLIT AND DELETED(1) | looks | braids(1) | dark skin(1) | ponytail(1) | very long hair(1) | white hair(2) | traits | Christian(1) | child(1)",7.04,1041,"OVA",1985,"{""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel's_Egg"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/天使のたまご"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/149639"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/14303.html"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=788"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208502"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/885""}","281_dfa23798f2f193d66f711292c136d3e6b3e6a239efbb0733d8099ee6c3905f18.png",\N,"281_dfa23798f2f193d66f711292c136d3e6b3e6a239efbb0733d8099ee6c3905f18.png",\N

A bit of inquiry reveals that the Duke has plans to marry the princess against her wishes... and perhaps other plans as well, one involving finding a priceless treasure lost for centuries. A beautiful damsel in distress, an evil Count to be smote, a lost treasure, and the biggest counterfeiting racket on the face of the earth... this is an order just too big for Lupin to resist! But it will take the combined effort of Lupin and all of his friends Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, the courageous and selfless Princess herself, and even the relentless Inspector Zenigata to thwart the Dukes plans and save the day! Excitement and mayhem are in store!","Tokyo Movie Shinsha",\N,"Miyazaki Hayao",\N,"Monkey Punch",\N,\N,\N,"Oono Yuuji",\N,\N,"[""15.12.1979"", ""15.12.1979"", ""15.12.1979"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"]","{""Inoue Makio"": ""Ishikawa Goemon"", ""Kobayashi Kiyoshi"": ""Jigen Daisuke"", ""Yamada Yasuo"": ""Lupin Sansei"", ""Masuyama Eiko"": ""Mine Fujiko"", ""Ishida Tarou"": ""Cagliostro Hakushaku"", ""Shimamoto Sumi"": ""Clarisse d` Cagliostro"", ""Azusa Kinpei"": ""Daishikyou"", ""Nagai Ichirou"": ""Jodo"", ""Naya Gorou"": ""Zenigata Kouichi""}","Movie","Autumn 1979","15.12.1979","plot continuity | action | gunfights | martial arts | swordplay | samurai | adventure | comedy | Japanese production | manga | place | Earth | Europe | time | past | seinen | awards | Oofuji Noburou Award | crime | thievery | damsel in distress | law and order | police","abilities | belly dance(1) | clever(1) | disguising(2) | gun marksmanship(1) | kendo(1) | accessories | bandage wrapping(1) | derringer(1) | helmet(1) | katana(1) | pistol(2) | revolver(1) | sarashi(1) | sunglasses(1) | clothing | boots(1) | business suit(1) | coat(1) | dress(1) | hakama(1) | high heels(1) | kimono(1) | knee boots(1) | string bikini(1) | entity | human(10) | fashion accessories | ascot tie(1) | elbow gloves(1) | fedora(2) | gloves(1) | hat(2) | necklace(1) | necktie(1) | pearl necklace(1) | pendant(1) | tiara(1) | veil(1) | fetish appeals | absolute cleavage(1) | large breasts(1) | looks | balding(1) | beard(1) | black eyebrows(1) | black eyes(2) | black hair(2) | blue eyes(2) | brown hair(3) | exposed midriff(1) | fair skin(1) | green hair(1) | long hair(1) | moustache(2) | periorbital dark circles(1) | short hair(1) | shoulder-length hair(1) | thick eyebrows(1) | nationality | Japanese(5) | mixed heritage(1) | role | archbishop(1) | aristocrat(2) | count(1) | crown heir(1) | femme fatale(1) | gentleman thief(1) | police officer(1) | princess(1) | thief(2) | traits | alluring(1) | altruistic(1) | barefoot(1) | brave(1) | dental fear(1) | manipulative(1) | middle aged(4) | perverted(1) | scantily clad(1) | shameless(1) | slutty(1) | smoker(1) | young adult(1)",8.2,1197,"Movie",1979,"{""Official website (en)"": ""http://www.tms-e.co.jp/english/search/introduction.php?pdt_no=139"", ""Official website"": ""https://lupin-3rd.net/mx4d/cagliostro/"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ルパン三世_カリオストロの城"", ""Prime Video"": ""https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0GM9W9BC3WZZ8GFCIK595SMUY5"", ""Crunchyroll"": ""https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G79H23W89/"", ""Netflix"": ""https://www.netflix.com/title/70050576"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1430"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/146948"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/1463.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/1400/time"", ""Animemorial"": ""http://www.animemorial.net/ja/m096-a"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=127"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079833""}","282_c060b8c123aa33609565f09c93412a88eb791f155501f627c07326907cd63217.png",\N,"282_c060b8c123aa33609565f09c93412a88eb791f155501f627c07326907cd63217.png",\N

"Shinseiki Evangelion Gekijouban: Shi to Shinsei","Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth","新世紀エヴァンゲリオン劇場版 シト新生","Originally a collection of clips from the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series, Death was created as a precursor to the reworked ending of the series. Rebirth was intended as that reworked ending, but after production overruns Rebirth became only the first half of the first episode of The End of Evangelion, with some minor differences. Over time, two newer directors cuts of Death were produced, each including new footage not seen in the series these were called DeathTrue and finally DeathTrue2. DeathTrue aired on 02.01.1998 on the Japanese satellite TV channel WOWOW. This version of Evangelion Death was personally reedited by Masayuki, removing much of the new footage from episodes 2124 that was contained in the original Death release. DeathTrue2 was released on 08.03.1998 as part of the Revival of Evangelion release, which is a unification of the movies DeathTrue2 a further edit of DeathTrue, with a few removed shots edited back in and The End of Evangelion.","Gainax Production I.G",\N,"Masayuki Tsurumaki Kazuya","Anno Hideaki","Anno Hideaki Gainax","Satsukawa Akio",\N,\N,"Sagisu Shirou","Sadamoto Yoshiyuki",\N,"[""15.03.1997"", ""15.03.1997"", ""08.03.1998"", ""15.03.1997"", """", """", """", """", """", """", """", """"]","{""Ogata Megumi"": ""Ikari Shinji"", ""Mitsuishi Kotono"": ""Katsuragi Misato"", ""Hayashibara Megumi"": ""Ayanami Rei"", ""Miyamura Yuuko"": ""Souryuu Asuka Langley""}","Movie, 2 movies","Winter 1996/97","15.03.1997","action | gunfights | angst | speculative fiction | daikaijuu | science fiction | alien | ancient aliens | human enhancement | genetic modification | mecha | robot | piloted robot | tropes | Tokyo is the centre of the universe | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | time | future | shounen | conspiracy | disaster | post-apocalyptic | military | air force | navy | school life | middle school","abilities | barrier creation(1) | clever(2) | cooking(1) | gardening(1) | leadership(1) | lethal chef(1) | levitation(2) | multilingual(2) | playing cello(1) | playing guitar(1) | regeneration(1) | time manipulation(1) | accessories | assault rifle(2) | box cutter(1) | eye visor(1) | glasses(3) | knife(2) | pistol(1) | rifle(2) | rocket launcher(1) | sunglasses(1) | video camera(1) | clothing | bodysuit(3) | high heels(1) | lab coat(2) | military uniform(2) | school uniform(3) | entity | alien(1) | angel - Evangelion(1) | clone(1) | human(16) | fashion accessories | cross pendant(1) | earring(2) | gloves(1) | hair beads(1) | fetish appeals | shota(1) | looks | beard(1) | black eyes(1) | black hair(2) | blue eyes(1) | blue hair(1) | brown eyes(4) | brown hair(6) | freckles(1) | grey hair(3) | long hair(2) | mole(1) | ponytail(1) | purple hair(1) | red eyes(2) | short hair(6) | shoulder-length hair(3) | stubble(1) | twintails(1) | yellow hair(1) | nationality | German(2) | Japanese(8) | mixed heritage(1) | organisation | secret organisation(1) | role | advisor(1) | butt monkey(1) | class president(1) | commander(1) | junior officer(4) | mecha pilot(5) | scientist(3) | senior officer(1) | spy(1) | student(6) | student council member(1) | traits | Kansai dialect(1) | adolescent(7) | antisocial personality disorder(1) | arrogant(2) | bad luck(1) | bibliophile(1) | brave(1) | charismatic(3) | competent(1) | confident(1) | cruel(1) | elderly(1) | emotionally stunted(1) | energetic(1) | friendly(1) | gun-military otaku(1) | homosexual(1) | impulsive(1) | indecisive(2) | inferiority complex(1) | insecure(2) | introvert(2) | iron-willed(1) | kind(2) | kuudere(1) | lazy(1) | loud(1) | loyal(1) | manipulative(1) | manly(1) | melancholic(1) | middle aged(1) | narcissistic(1) | nihilistic(1) | possessive(1) | pragmatic(3) | quiet(1) | rude(1) | scorpio(1) | selfish(2) | short-tempered(2) | smoker(1) | stoic(1) | strict(3) | trauma(2) | tsundere(1) | vegetarian(1) | vitriolic(1) | workaholic(2) | yareyare-kei(1) | young adult(6) | type | Evangelion(3) | conscious(3)",6.95,970,"Movie",1997,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.gainax.co.jp/anime/eva/"", ""Twitter"": ""https://twitter.com/evangelion_co"", ""Netflix"": ""https://www.netflix.com/title/81033473"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/89709"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/623.html"", ""douban"": ""https://movie.douban.com/subject/1455442"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/472/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=418"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28717062"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/31"", ""TMDB"": ""https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/857862""}","287_f1d30507d1ae8fcf029e2c8dacca28c2d1f156216f541bc6033f86056d6ba176.png",\N,"287_f1d30507d1ae8fcf029e2c8dacca28c2d1f156216f541bc6033f86056d6ba176.png",\N

And so Otarus relatively tranquil days become very much more emotional and lively thanks to Lime... especially since other parties already have become aware of Limes special nature. written by foo2","Studio Junio",\N,"Shimoda Masami",\N,"Akahori Satoru","Sekijima Mayori",\N,\N,"Parome","Shimamura Hidekazu",\N,"[""01.10.1996"", ""08.10.1996"", ""15.10.1996"", ""22.10.1996"", ""29.10.1996"", ""05.11.1996"", ""12.11.1996"", ""19.11.1996"", ""26.11.1996"", ""03.12.1996"", ""10.12.1996"", ""17.12.1996"", ""24.12.1996"", ""07.01.1997"", ""14.01.1997"", ""21.01.1997"", ""28.01.1997"", ""04.02.1997"", ""11.02.1997"", ""18.02.1997"", ""25.02.1997"", ""04.03.1997"", ""11.03.1997"", ""18.03.1997"", ""25.03.1997"", ""01.10.1996"", ""01.10.1996"", ""22.10.1996""]","{""Hiramatsu Akiko"": ""Bloodberry"", ""Shiratori Yuri"": ""Cherry"", ""Hayashibara Megumi"": ""Lime"", ""Imai Yuka"": ""Mamiya Otaru"", ""Orikasa Ai"": ""Baikou"", ""Nagashima Yuuichi"": ""Gennai"", ""Midorikawa Hikaru"": ""Gerhard von Faust"", ""Mizutani Yuuko"": ""Luchs"", ""Koyasu Takehito"": ""Mitsurugi Hanagata"", ""Chiba Shigeru"": ""Ooekubo Hikozaemon""}","TV Series, 25 episodes","Autumn 1996","01.10.1996 until 25.03.1997","violence | cast | strong female lead | ending | happy ending | plot continuity | action | collateral damage | martial arts | comedy | absurdist humour | parody | slapstick | lethal chef | ecchi | Gainax bounce | skimpy clothing | harem | memory transfer | romance | speculative fiction | science fiction | Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? | mecha | robot | android | robot helper | space travel | steampunk | super power | emotions awaken superpowers | tragedy | tropes | lost technology | under one roof | Japanese production | novel | place | space | other planet | time | future | season | winter | shounen | anti-war | cooking | coup d`etat | crime | kidnapping | disaster | post-apocalyptic | war | the arts | performance | barbecue | beauty pageant | boobs in your face | confession | cooking contest | fireworks | first kiss | flashback | furo scene | hot springs visit | lap pillow | lottery wheel | New Year`s Day | omimai | parting | physical examination | piggyback ride | pillow fight | town festival","clothing | crop top(1) | high heels(1) | jacket(1) | kimono(1) | miniskirt(1) | pencil skirt(1) | entity | android(4) | fashion accessories | earring(2) | epaulette(1) | fingerless gloves(1) | hairpin(1) | lipstick(1) | necktie(1) | sweatband(1) | fetish appeals | cleavage(1) | large breasts(2) | looks | blue eyes(1) | blue hair(2) | cuteness fang(1) | drill hair(1) | exposed midriff(1) | green eyes(1) | hair bangs(1) | hair over both eyes(1) | ponytail(2) | purple hair(1) | red hair(1) | sidelocks(1) | very long hair(3) | yellow hair(1) | role | harem lead(1) | traits | energetic(1) | extrovert(1) | overeater(1)",7.24,1295,"TV Series",1996,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.sotsu-ag.co.jp/details/35.html"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Marionette"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/セイバーマリオネット"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/88965"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/715.html"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=77"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/573""}","302_09a596c1938bdcb35c50d20f9aec0ca4a1bbae5afabeaa3f25df35f593fc68a1.png","191_f6ad6021daacfbf5f4ae13fa3691eba80ce4c3568dd552e012427950251abdef.png","191_068bf5cd2368d34d4b344f65155d8513a8e8300226feb5477152ba7f483a927a.png","191_3eed85359a7fd12521b1485551b492901f9a5962b892a40e943ee2916a0cb84f"

Amamori Hajime is just a normal, everyday elementary school student, trying to study and hanging out with his crazy pals. But then one day as his father is testing a piece of equipment he has been working on, something causes it to blow up, taking the house with it! Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncles observatory, he meets a girl hes seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, shes his uncles assistant! What luck! But Yayoi isnt exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamorisan at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen SenNen Joou, specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. However, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi? And how does he know about the Millennial Queen, anyway? Queen Millennia is Leiji Matsumotos classic anime series. Though not as famous as other Matsumoto shows in the west, it was a huge hit in Asia. This show has an intricate and intelligent plot, plus some hauntingly beautiful background music. The contrasting fragility and strength of Yukino Yayoi distinguishes her as one of the most memorable characters in anime.","Toei Animation","Kanemori Yoshinori","Nobutaka Nishizawa","Nishizawa Nobutaka","Matsumoto Reiji",\N,\N,\N,"Asakawa Tomoyuki Uzaki Ryuudou","Kanemori Yoshinori","Fuji TV Toei","[""16.04.1981"", ""23.04.1981"", ""30.04.1981"", ""07.05.1981"", ""14.05.1981"", ""21.05.1981"", ""28.05.1981"", ""11.06.1981"", ""25.06.1981"", ""09.07.1981"", ""23.07.1981"", ""30.07.1981"", ""13.08.1981"", ""27.08.1981"", ""10.09.1981"", ""17.09.1981"", ""24.09.1981"", ""01.10.1981"", ""08.10.1981"", ""15.10.1981"", ""22.10.1981"", ""29.10.1981"", ""05.11.1981"", ""12.11.1981"", ""19.11.1981"", ""26.11.1981"", ""03.12.1981"", ""10.12.1981"", ""17.12.1981"", ""24.12.1981"", ""07.01.1982"", ""14.01.1982"", ""21.01.1982"", ""28.01.1982"", ""04.02.1982"", ""11.02.1982"", ""18.02.1982"", ""25.02.1982"", ""04.03.1982"", ""11.03.1982"", ""18.03.1982"", ""25.03.1982"", """", """", """", """", """", """"]","{""Toda Keiko"": ""Amamori Hajime"", ""Nagai Ichirou"": ""Amamori-kyouju"", ""Han Keiko"": ""La Andromeda Promethium II Yukino Yayoi"", ""Sugiyama Kazuko"": ""Mirai"", ""Asagami Youko"": ""Selen""}","TV Series, 42 episodes","Spring 1981","16.04.1981 until 25.03.1982","cast | stereotypes | strong female lead | plot continuity | action | adventure | angst | speculative fiction | science fiction | alien | humanoid alien | space travel | super power | thriller | tragedy | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | domestic cat | Japanese production | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | space | shipboard | shounen | coming of age | conspiracy","clothing | leather jacket(1) | turtleneck sweater(1) | fashion accessories | crown(1) | necklace(1) | fetish appeals | absolute cleavage(1) | looks | green hair(1) | long hair(1) | very long hair(3) | yellow hair(2)",7.11,1823,"TV Series",1981,"{""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Millennia#Anime_TV"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/新竹取物語_1000年女王"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/89385"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/626.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/3998/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=487"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1548""}","323_d0629952e3131bf4c251881a5d5b3fd9322f4a6de99bf707ccd81cbd22ec563e.png",\N,"200_7121939f12346a5f0a5692ba892c6f5fe013944cfe6ee824da9e1aa61c3422ea.png","200_f48b456fababe6b74d50ae12997012deb58d17d9153495656b4663f0c1762d7f"

At the center of the turmoil is the mysterious Orphan. Orphan may or may not be the original cause of the cataclysms. Orphans goal is to raise a ship hidden deep beneath the sea to the surface, but doing so would result in the destruction of all humans except for the small number which are loyal to Orphan. Orphans agents pilot mysterious mecha known as Grand Cheres, and search the world for mysterious, giant disks which occasionally appear, flying at high speeds and wrecking much of the countryside, or cities, when they hit the ground. After a dying disc almost kills Hime, a Brain Powerd is born from the disc. Brain Powerds are another type of Mecha, similar to but not the same as Grand Cheres. Hime becomes the Brain Powerds pilot, forming a symbiotic relationship with the living mecha and joins an International Organization dedicated to stopping Orphan, or at the very least saving humanity should Orphan succeed.","Sunrise",\N,"Yoshiyuki Tomino","Tomino Yoshiyuki","Tomino Yoshiyuki Yatate Hajime",\N,\N,\N,"Kanno Youko","Shigeta Atsushi",\N,"[""08.04.1998"", ""15.04.1998"", ""22.04.1998"", ""29.04.1998"", ""06.05.1998"", ""13.05.1998"", ""20.05.1998"", ""27.05.1998"", ""17.06.1998"", ""24.06.1998"", ""01.07.1998"", ""08.07.1998"", ""22.07.1998"", ""29.07.1998"", ""05.08.1998"", ""12.08.1998"", ""19.08.1998"", ""26.08.1998"", ""16.09.1998"", ""23.09.1998"", ""30.09.1998"", ""14.10.1998"", ""21.10.1998"", ""28.10.1998"", ""04.11.1998"", ""11.11.1998"", ""08.04.1998"", ""19.08.1998"", ""08.04.1998"", ""15.04.1998""]","{""Shiratori Tetsu"": ""Isami Yuu"", ""Murata Akino"": ""Utsumiya Hime"", ""Isobe Masako"": ""Anoa McCormick Baron Maximillian"", ""Sakura Shouko"": ""Akari Comodo Mahama"", ""Kawamura Maria"": ""Higgins Saz"", ""Nagoshi Shiho"": ""Irene Carrier"", ""Horibe Ryuuichi"": ""Isami Kensaku"", ""Kanoki Shouko"": ""Isami Midori"", ""Sugimoto Rumi"": ""Isami Naoko"", ""Aoba Gou"": ""Jonathan Glenn""}","TV Series, 26 episodes","Spring 1998","08.04.1998 until 11.11.1998","nudity | cast | stereotypes | strong female lead | strong male lead | plot continuity | slow-paced | action | adventure | comedy | romance | boy meets girl | speculative fiction | daikaijuu | fantasy | contemporary fantasy | science fiction | alien | mecha | organic mecha | robot | piloted robot | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | time | future | multi-anime projects | Super Robot Wars | remastered version available | daily life | disaster | post-apocalyptic | military | air force | navy","accessories | glasses(1) | sunglasses(2) | clothing | crop top(1) | high heels(1) | scarf(1) | thigh boots(1) | entity | human(1) | fashion accessories | cross pendant(1) | ear cuffs(1) | earring(2) | lipstick(1) | sweatband(1) | looks | beard(1) | black hair(1) | blue eyes(1) | dark skin(2) | dreadlocks(1) | exposed midriff(2) | goatee(2) | long hair(1) | muscular(1) | orange hair(1) | ponytail(1) | purple hair(1) | tanned(1) | thick lips(1) | twintails(1) | very long hair(2) | role | mecha pilot(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | child(3) | young adult(3)",6.04,1035,"TV Series",1998,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.sunrise-inc.co.jp/work/detail.php?cid=132"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Powerd"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ブレンパワード"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/90338"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/1656.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/529/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=122"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1542""}","329_5ad4877242a5889bae595796c664c52b9fe37e790fb362999f39cf7f08cf346e.png","202_8fec9d2a34b8f37234ffda70220cb4ec7b27b23c686f569d02bdb0b1146bdca6.png","202_0d1667b27084cae680466a495093d51ac6d0fd1b4bbf9b8c53ce13bb43f7dcf1.png","202_c4707142309600ebeeea6cd893cb2435bfe4e297e5b69f0e829184a6aa3213aa"

It turns out young Marlene is actually the Kings daughter, and happens to be going through a rebellious phase she wants her allowance raised but her daddy refused, so she has taken to harassing the town with her dragons until he gives in... Meanwhile Naga has followed Marlene to her stronghold, to teach her a thing or two about how to laugh properly, for a price of course. Once again it is Lina versus Naga, and father versus daughter in a noholdsbarred, dragonfighting, spelltossing extravaganza!","J.C.

This was decided by their fathers, and was pretty much against their will. To make matters worse, after martial arts training at the Magical Springs in China, Ranmas father Genma is cursed to change into a panda and Ranma is cursed to change into a beautiful buxom female whenever doused in cold water.

"Hyper Police",\N,"はいぱーぽりす","It is the 22nd year of the new Holy Era. With the fall of the previous age brought about by human folly, lawlessness runs rampant and disorder rules the world. But here in Shinjuku, the City of the Beasts, any creature who would harm another must contend with us, one and all. Our wild blood runs hot tonight! Hyper Police to the rescue! from intro In these postapocalyptic times beast creatures from lore have reappeared and now try to interact with normal humans. The police force has grudgingly accepted help from privatized bounty hunters, and various police businesses fight over the rewards for capturing wanted criminals. Few humans like the beast creatures, and they rarely interact. The Police Company is one such private business, where the 17yearold halfhuman halfnekomata Sasahara Natsuki, and her tough werewolf partner Batanen try to make ends meet on a daily basis.

Numerous comets have passed and detected in our solar system, and because of that, there are fears and unpredictable dangers that some of them may crashed upon the earth and will cause mass destruction on the planet. Therefore, as a part of Cosmic Crisis Management, mankind built a comet impact cemetery above earths satellite orbit. This comet impact cemetery equipped with Space Shock Machines that will eliminate those comets before they can reach the earth. Those space shock machines are flown by female pilots, who also known as the Storm Troops, and are armed with special missiles to destroy incoming comets into small pieces. Those girls are soon to be known as Comet Blasters and are very popular among people on earth. On earth, in various places, many comet impact cemeteries were also made as second line of defence, so that in the event of large comet fragments passed the Comet Blasters, it can be destroyed by the Meteor Sweeper who fired special missiles from earth. At the same time, these comet impact cemeteries on earth provide training grounds where young pilots are trained to gain qualification as future Comet Blasters.","Studio Fantasia","Yamauchi Noriyasu","Mori Takeshi",\N,"Studio Fantasia","Takayama Katsuhiko",\N,\N,"Amano Masamichi","Yamauchi Noriyasu",\N,"[""05.01.2003"", ""12.01.2003"", ""19.01.2003"", ""26.01.2003"", ""02.02.2003"", ""09.02.2003"", ""16.02.2003"", ""23.02.2003"", ""02.03.2003"", ""09.03.2003"", ""16.03.2003"", ""23.03.2003"", ""30.03.2003"", ""25.08.2006"", """", """", """", """", """", ""05.01.2003"", """", ""05.01.2003"", ""23.02.2003"", """", """"]","{""Shimizu Kaori"": ""Doi Shizuha"", ""Kakazu Yumi"": ""Honjou Mikaze"", ""Orikasa Fumiko"": ""Kikuhara Karin"", ""Kikuchi Shiho"": ""Nakamura Ayamo"", ""Toyoguchi Megumi"": ""Annette Kaley"", ""Yukino Satsuki"": ""Betty Busemann"", ""Asakawa Yuu"": ""Chris Kalman"", ""Seki Tomokazu"": ""Fujitani Kei"", ""Yoshino Hiroyuki"": ""Ikeda Sora"", ""Tsujitani Kouji"": ""Iwasaki Kazuma""}","TV Series, 13 episodes","Winter 2002/03","05.01.2003 until 30.03.2003","ending | open-ended | plot continuity | action | gunfights | angst | comedy | slapstick | ecchi | pantsu | parasite | speculative fiction | science fiction | alien | alien invasion | tropes | Engrish | Japanese production | new | place | Earth | Asia | Japan | space | shipboard | time | future | friendship | military | air force | hot springs visit","accessories | glasses(3) | headset(1) | helmet(4) | clothing | bodysuit(4) | business suit(1) | cheongsam(4) | military uniform(2) | skirt(1) | thighhighs(3) | entity | domestic cat(1) | human(20) | fashion accessories | cap(1) | choker(4) | earring(1) | necktie(2) | ring(1) | fetish appeals | medium breasts(2) | looks | beard(1) | black hair(2) | blue eyes(3) | blue hair(2) | blunt bangs(1) | braids(1) | brown eyes(4) | brown hair(6) | cyan eyes(2) | exposed midriff(1) | green eyes(2) | green hair(1) | grey eyes(1) | grey fur(1) | grey hair(3) | hair bangs(1) | hair loops(1) | long hair(1) | moustache(1) | pink hair(1) | purple eyes(1) | purple hair(1) | red eyes(1) | red hair(1) | short hair(6) | shoulder-length hair(1) | thick eyebrows(1) | twintails(1) | very long hair(1) | white fur(1) | white hair(1) | wrinkled skin(1) | yellow eyes(1) | yellow hair(2) | role | pilot(4) | traits | adolescent(6) | ambitious(1) | elderly(2) | lazy(1) | middle aged(1) | passionate(1) | scantily clad(1) | short-tempered(1) | smoker(1) | young adult(11) | type | aircraft(5) | bomber(1) | space station(1) | spaceship(3) | two-seater(1)",7.38,1294,"TV Series",2003,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.stratos4.jp"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratos_4"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ストラトス・フォー"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/240377"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/5790.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/33/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1969"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/1903""}","399_c5cfec7fb009df3a443c693518d2817a822444eb8664b566a2be54bcd5df8761.png",\N,"230_c647d465ae66407fceb4da0907d33c5e2053d9fc360dd7d93f4f829129793861.png","230_df7829f1d196e4bc8f829b2749a53ce0c98cd730e26d61a1e2b0e937725a1dad"

Gokudou does get his wishes, though not exactly in the fashion that he expected.

"Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho","The Place Promised in Our Early Days","雲のむこう, 約束の場所","In an alternate history of the aftermath of World War II, Japan has been cleaved in half, with the south Honshu and the other islands allied with the United States and the northern island Hokkaido annexed by the enigmatic Union. It was on Hokkaido that a mysterious tower had been built, a strand of metal reaching up out of the atmosphere, clearly visible from the northern tip of Honshu. In 1996, three teenagers, Hiroki, Takuya and Sayuri, make a pact they will build an experimental aircraft, almost invisible to surveillance, cross over to Hokkaido and unlock the secrets of the tower. Their dream was never realized, because Sayuri was sent to Tokyo for treatment after she fell into a coma. It is now three years later. The rosy illusions of youth have fallen away, but not the unbreakable strength of the trios promise. The truth of the tower will be uncovered, and with it, the link between it and Sayuris mysterious, carefully tended condition. written by Rupert Bottenberg from www.fantasiafestival.comenfilmsfilmdetail.php?id40","CoMix Wave","Tazawa Ushio","Shinkai Makoto",\N,"Shinkai Makoto",\N,\N,\N,"Tenmon","Tazawa Ushio","CoMix Wave Shinkai Makoto","[""20.11.2004"", ""20.11.2004"", ""20.11.2004"", ""20.11.2004"", ""20.11.2004"", ""20.11.2004"", """", """", """", """", """", ""06.08.2004"", ""06.08.2004""]","{""Yoshioka Hidetaka"": ""Fujisawa Hiroki"", ""Nanri Yuuka"": ""Sawatari Sayuri"", ""Hagiwara Masato"": ""Shirakawa Takuya""}","Movie","Autumn 2004","20.11.2004","violence | ending | happy ending | open-ended | plot continuity | time skip | action | angst | romance | speculative fiction | science fiction | tragedy | Japanese production | new | place | countryside | Earth | Asia | Japan | Hokkaido | time | present | alternative present | season | winter | seinen | remastered version available | stand-alone movie | coming of age | daily life | disaster | post-war | military | air force | navy | nostalgia | promise | childhood promise | school life | high school | middle school | star-crossed lovers | tales | Sleeping Beauty | the effects of time and distance on human relationships | changing room scene | flashback","accessories | glasses(1) | entity | human(3) | looks | brown hair(2) | long hair(1) | nationality | Japanese(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | lonely(1) | melancholic(1)",8.18,1039,"Movie",2004,"{""Official website"": ""http://www.cwfilms.jp/kumonomukou/"", ""Wiki (zh)"": ""https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/雲之彼端，約定的地方"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Place_Promised_in_Our_Early_Days"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/雲のむこう、約束の場所"", ""Wiki (ko)"": ""https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/구름의_저편,_약속의_장소"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/241003"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/7135.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/668/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2324"", ""IMDB"": ""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381348"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/433""}","423_6153f8443ab6c5f74ea13d7bcc2ad8a6245a835d957c72330353edb8b5e08878.png",\N,"423_6153f8443ab6c5f74ea13d7bcc2ad8a6245a835d957c72330353edb8b5e08878.png",\N

"Patapata Hikousen no Bouken",\N,"パタパタ飛行船の冒険","Inspired by and loosely based on Jules Vernes stories Facing the Flag and The City in the Sahara. A young lady of the noble Buxton family, Jane, is a vivid and cheerful girl, whose long yearning dream is to fly into the clouds and beyond. Being surrounded by the love of her family members as well as that of the servants, Janes life was a relatively happy one. Her emotions, however, are in turmoil when a letter arrives informing that Janes eldest and beloved brother, George, who was participating on the expedition to the East, was executed. At the same time, Janes stepbrother, William, leaves the family due to the protracted feud with their father, who soon after is charged for embezzling. Days pass by and one day, Jane receives an envelope sent anonymously. Inside, there is a tiny piece of cerulean stone and right in front of Janes eyes a mysterious phenomenon occurs... Could this be the Floating Water George was searching for? And could this be a letter sent by George? Jane wonders. Convinced of Georges survival, Jane decides to embark on a quest to the unknown land in the East to find her brothers. An adventure begins that will lead her from the safety of her English manor house to the vast foreboding deserts of the Middle East and then to isolated mountain trails somewhere in the Caucasus. Chasing after various clues appearing only as hushed rumours and forgotten legends, Jane and her protective fellow travellers find themselves having to fight off a band of soldiers equipped with strange airships, who are seemingly intent on keeping the Cerulean Sand a secret from all outsiders.","Telecom Animation Film",\N,"Yano Yuuichirou",\N,"Jules Verne",\N,\N,\N,"Ikeda Daisuke Nakagawa Toshio","Hachizaki Kenji",\N,"[""05.01.2002"", ""12.01.2002"", ""26.01.2002"", ""02.02.2002"", ""09.02.2002"", ""16.02.2002"", ""23.02.2002"", ""02.03.2002"", ""09.03.2002"", ""16.03.2002"", ""23.03.2002"", ""30.03.2002"", ""06.04.2002"", ""13.04.2002"", ""20.04.2002"", ""27.04.2002"", ""04.05.2002"", ""11.05.2002"", ""18.05.2002"", ""25.05.2002"", ""01.06.2002"", ""08.06.2002"", ""15.06.2002"", ""22.06.2002"", ""29.06.2002"", ""29.06.2002"", """", """"]","{""Suzuki Masakazu"": ""George Buxton"", ""Kogure Ema"": ""Jane Buxton"", ""Mizuma Maki"": ""Sabri"", ""Ookawa Tooru"": ""William F Buxton"", ""Ootsuka Akio"": ""Christophe Balzac"", ""Tsukada Masaaki"": ""Edward Buxton"", ""Kusumi Naomi"": ""Marcenay"", ""Madono Mitsuaki"": ""Moririre"", ""Naya Rokurou"": ""San Bellan"", ""Ogata Mitsuru"": ""Sky""}","TV Series, 26 episodes","Winter 2001/02","05.01.2002 until 29.06.2002","violence | cast | stereotypes | plot continuity | time skip | action | collateral damage | gunfights | swordplay | adventure | angst | comedy | slapstick | social commentary | speculative fiction | fantasy | science fiction | steampunk | tragedy | tropes | important haircut | TO BE MOVED TO CHARACTER | blimp | charismatic | clumsy | evil laugh | mask | overeater | TO BE MOVED TO EPISODE | flashback | omimai | Japanese production | novel | place | desert | Earth | Africa | Asia | Europe | United Kingdom | time | past | alternative past | CGI | 3D CG animation | anti-war | coming of age | conspiracy | death | murder | family life | family without mother | following one`s dream | friendship | heart-warming | military | money | grandiose displays of wealth | slavery | sociocultural evolution","accessories | glasses(1) | entity | dog(1) | fashion accessories | hairband(1) | looks | brown hair(1) | grey hair(2) | moustache(2) | role | aristocrat(2) | butler(1) | widow(1) | traits | adolescent(1) | tomboy(1)",7.83,1609,"TV Series",2002,"{""Official website (en)"": ""http://www.tms-e.com/english/search/index.php?pdt_no=189"", ""Official website"": ""http://www.tms-e.com/search/index.php?pdt_no=119"", ""Wiki (en)"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Cerulean_Sand"", ""Wiki (jp)"": ""https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/パタパタ飛行船の冒険"", "".lain"": ""http://lain.gr.jp/mediadb/media/786"", ""Allcinema"": ""https://www.allcinema.net/cinema/236611"", ""Anison"": ""http://anison.info/data/program/5059.html"", ""Syoboi"": ""https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/2688/time"", ""ANN"": ""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=309"", ""MAL"": ""https://myanimelist.net/anime/708""}","431_db0c9d0a937433fe1490d3a723fe72442b87e528debd27c489354ad09ef32fca.png",\N,"247_0a3f2e1e2be1c3f40ca137f32dc68725aca4ddbcad95553efb14ddf7f54b724a.png",\N

Lacking the strength to overcome her alone, Enno enlisted the help of Zenki, a formidable protector demon. Following Karuma's defeat, Enno sealed Zenki within a pillar inside his temple. Fast forward 1,200 years to the present day, where Enno's descendant Chiaki resides in Shikigami-cho, guiding tourists and performing exorcisms for a living.
